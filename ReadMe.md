This is supposed to be a tool to build synchronizable presentations (Future), instead of the presentation itself (Now).

Most of the work is in progress & there is no timeline.

This branch is always in sync with a deployment on http://slides.netroy.in/ hosted by the amazing folks at @nodester

There is a lot to be done & there is no timeline.
If you have any issues/feature-suggestions, create a task on github.
