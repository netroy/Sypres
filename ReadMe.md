This is supposed to be a tool to build synchronize presentations (Future), instead of the presentation itself (Now).

Most of the work is in progress & there is no timeline.

This branch is always in sync with a deployment [here](http://slides.netroy.in/) hosted by the amazing folks at @nodester .

There is a lot to be done & there is no timeline.
If you have any issues/feature-suggestions, create a task on github.


PS: The intro slide style was shamelessly copied from <http://speakerdeck.com/u/robhawkes/p/websockets-embracing-the-real-time-web> & the fonts used are "Open Sans Condensed" & "Marvel" from [google's font directory](http://www.google.com/webfonts)


ToDo:

* fix the UI for mobile & tablets ... with touch/swipe support
* pdf export to upload to third party sites
* hook up the irc code for Q/A (or add a box on the UI for that, for people who authenticate)
* Fix internet situations at indian community conferences so that this tool becomes of some use to myself (not related to the project, but undoubtably important)
* add controls to navigate & fullscreen the presentation
